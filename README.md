# quad

Made with [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), a Rust game engine!

I could've used [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/) (and what a naming intrigue that would be!) but for my laziness, hence the fork*

Simply meant to demonstrate features I like

Feel free to mention preferences in issues or use this code (so long as you mind the license)
